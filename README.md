# network-security-project
Built a virtualized network in GNS3 within VMware, applied ISO router security checklist, and performed vulnerability scans using GFI LANguard to strengthen network security.


This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure virtual network using **GNS3** inside **VMware Workstation**, following professional router security standards.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- GNS3 (for network simulation)  
- VMware Workstation  
- GFI LANguard (for vulnerability scanning)  
- ISO Router Security Checklist  

## Project Overview  
- Designed and configured a fully virtualized enterprise network.  
- Applied ISO router security checklist to harden router configurations.  
- Performed **pre- and post-implementation vulnerability scans** using GFI LANguard.  
- Documented the network setup and results for security analysis.
